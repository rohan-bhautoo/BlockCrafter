# Introduction

BlockCrafter is a sandbox adventure game built using Unreal Engine. Inspired by the simplicity and creativity of games like Minecraft, BlockCrafter offers a unique experience where players can build, destroy, and explore an open world. Armed with a rifle and a shotgun, players must also defend themselves against various enemies. The game features a default mode for creative building and exploration, and a survival mode where players face waves of attacking enemies.
